# Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.
It is a model used to predict the optimum number of clusters and visualization of it. 
Here the model is trained with k-means clustering algorithm.
A cluster is a group of data points that are similar to each other based on their relation to surrounding data points. Clustering is used for things like feature engineering or pattern discovery.
